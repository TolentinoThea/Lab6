<br>  <h2 class="highlight">When Everything Is In Chaos Just Smile </br> </h2>
<center> <img src="justsmile.jpg"> </center>
<br> <p> Have you ever experienced when you're on the most chaos scene, when all the people around you feel hopeless and negative such as unexpected presentation in work or school or being late and your boss will be visiting you? Or, maybe worst than these scenarios. I know all of us have their unforgettable memories, but what did you do to overcome this ? Maybe you have your answer but for those who do not, I have mine to share. 

When you're in the most pressured or stressed out moment, the easiest thing to do first is breathe and smile then imagine the most happy moment in your life or people that inspires you, automatically it can change your mood then you can think better and work faster to create solutions of such dilemma.

You can also sing your favorite song to make you feel relaxed such as singing praise and worship songs of God (it works better than those pop song). Also, you can drink water with ice cubes to calm all your nerves.

For me it is very important on how we handle the situation 'cause it can mold you into a better person in time. 

Smile and just breathe. </br> </p>

 <br> <p> When I was young, my household consisted of my mother, my grandmother, and my uncle. I had no contact with my father. My mother took a passive role in my upbringing causing my grandmother to raise me primarily. I lost her to severe pneumonia when I was 10. My mother tried to continue my grandmother's efforts; although, began to fall short. She did not work and withdrew most days leaving me to my own actions/thoughts. My uncle, who was providing all financial support passed when I was 11 leaving my mother and myself with no financial support. 
She applied for financial assistance and we were barely surviving. With my mother’s withdrawal from life, little financial skills, and poor organization I did not have food, clothes, or discipline. After an investigation by child services, I was placed in foster care. Upon returning to my mother's care, I had lost hope of a "normal" life. 
Prior to placement in foster care, I had volunteered at the local hospital to gain hospital experience, since I had wanted to be a doctor. After the foster home experience, I felt alone and destitute. I saw no hope of obtaining such a grand educational journey. 
At the age of 20, my son was born and I began working long hours. The relationship with his mother did not last. I continued to work; although, had many ups and downs along the path. My mother passed away when I was 23 leaving me with no close family. My father continued to be removed. I struggled with the gap in my life and felt alone, but continued on and was married at the age of 24. My daughter was born and I promised myself to strive higher in life. I took a chance and applied for a better job, which would double my salary —I was accepted! My life was again changed due to divorce and a lay-off at 27 years old. For my children, I decided to pursue college and my dream. Succeed or not, at least I tried. 
I began at the local community college and was then able to transfer to a 4-year college for a degree in Biology. I applied to 5 medical schools in the area to stay close to my children. I was accepted in 2006. I dedicated myself and did not let anything distract me from my goal.	
I am now a practicing physician and could not be happier. I did eventually become close to my father only to lose him a few months before my medical school graduation. I am close with my son, who is now 22 and my daughter, who will soon be 18. I continue my journey to advanced leadership positions and continue to refuse negativity. I continue to be inspired by those I meet who have gone through much worse than I and have achieved success. 
We can all obtain so much in our lives. I hope this story provides you hope. </br> </p>

 <br> <h2 class="highlight"> Fighting Spirit! </br> </h2>

<br> <p> I had just a very wonderful day but, all my days are always wonderful to me! But today was completely different, today there was a bulletin board saying that they'll need to find Volleyball players for the girls and I was so happy! I love playing volleyball when my mother taught me how to play. I was so excited that I couldn't wait to play! Then I read more what was in that bulletin board and said that there would be an audition after three weeks! "Three weeks?!" I thought and think about it. I do know how to play volleyball but I'm not much of an expert in doing it but! I still have to try. After that I was determined to practice volleyball everyday, and since that day I planned on practicing starting the next day and I did. I practiced and practiced harder each day and I never get tired of doing the same practices through all the days, and finally, the day has come. I was so prepared for this and hurried to the gym to audition. Whence I had reached the gym I was surprised to see for like, 12 or 14 girls lining up! and I guess I was the last one to arrive. Then our auditions began, some of the girls failed to pass the auditions and some passed the auditions problem is, there was only 1 slot left to complete the 6 girls to join the volleyball team and suddenly I felt nervous because the person in front of me was going to take her serve. Then the girl hit the ball and then. . . . . . the ball didn't pass over the net. Th girl slapped her forehead and left, leaving me standing in the middle of the court. Then the coach spoke "okay, you, serve" she handed me the ball and I caught it with my hands. As the ball was in my hands, my hands were suddenly sweating and so am I! I then suddenly became nervous about this 'maybe I should back off' I told myself very unsure that I will pass the auditions. Then it hit me. All of these practices that I've done the past 3 weeks was all for the day of the auditions where I'm sure I can pass it perfectly! I didn't practice playing volleyball for nothing, I practiced this for today, I was determined to do this so i have to do this with all my fighting spirit! Then I began, I came to a pause, inhaled deeply and exhaled. I swing my arm way back ahead and hit the ball and it. . . . . .and it. . . . . . . .and it. . . . . . . . . . Yes! and it passed over the net!!! I was so happy i jumped in joy! that was the highest serve I did in the past few weeks I practiced serving and this, this was the best I did! The coach clapped and the people around me gave an standing ovation and I was so proud of myself. And I realized that determination can make you to a successful ending. </br> </p>
